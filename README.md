### General information 
- Everything is separate and kind of in its hierarchy.
- This folder structure is very effective when having complex projects and a large team of developers.
- Code has very less comments that's intentional because a good code should be self-explanatory without explicit comments. 
- To make this more realistic we have used fakestoreapi.com for login and fetching data.

### Tests 
- We have written tests using Jest and can be found under src/__tests__ folder
